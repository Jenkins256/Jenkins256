            <h2>Copeland Gallery, London, August 2022</h2>
            <p>The work explores what can be defined as a photograph in the modern age. The photographs I create are not intended to be understood but to be felt, experienced and seen.
            </p>
            <p>The processes aim to create discord within the traditional photographic processes. I take inspiration from previous artistic movements and most importantly jazz, to create a method of spontaneity directly related to the materials which result in unpredictable images that are dislocated from the tangible world, responding to the environment in which they are displayed.</p>

            <h3>Striking Artistry</h3>
             <p>Thomas Jenkins (b. 1992) is a visual artist working with photographic processes. His work explores colour and abstraction to question what is defined as a photograph in the modern day. The methods stem from interests in contemporary and historical photography, painting and sculpture.</p>
