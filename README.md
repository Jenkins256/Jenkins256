- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jenkins256
- 👀 I’m interested in web and software development. After years climbing the corporate ladder, I'm looking to make a career change. I self taught HTML, CSS and Javascript years ago and really enjoyed the process. I'm now looking to get into a web or software development career. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JS and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any rojects possible. Please feel free to critique and advise on anything you see on my github.
- 📫 Reach me on anthony.jenkins13@outlook.com

- ⚡ My very first attempt at coding was C++ for Operational Flashpoint in the year 2000s!
